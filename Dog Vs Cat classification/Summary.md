## âœ… Model Choice Summary

For this project, I chose the **Random Forest Classifier** as the main model. I selected this model because:

- It performs well with minimal parameter tuning.
- It handles both numerical and categorical features effectively.
- It is robust to overfitting, especially with a limited dataset.
- It provides feature importance, which helps in understanding the most relevant inputs.

After comparing it with other models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, Random Forest achieved higher accuracy and better overall performance.

### ðŸ”„ One Improvement with More Time

If I had more time, I would improve the model by applying **hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV**. Additionally, I would explore **ensemble techniques** like **XGBoost or LightGBM**, which often outperform traditional models in structured data tasks. I would also work on further **feature engineering** and possibly **dimensionality reduction** to improve performance and generalization.
