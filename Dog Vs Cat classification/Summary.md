# Model Selection and Improvement

## Model Selection:

In this project, the goal was to classify images of dogs and cats using deep learning. Two models were used: **Transfer Learning with MobileNet** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

### 1. **Transfer Learning with MobileNet**:
   - **Why MobileNet?**
     - MobileNet is a lightweight, efficient pre-trained model that works well for image classification tasks. It is optimized for performance and can run on less powerful hardware, making it suitable for real-time predictions, even with large datasets.
     - The MobileNet model was utilized through TensorFlow Hub, using the pre-trained weights to avoid starting from scratch. This helps in leveraging features learned from a large-scale dataset, making it highly suitable for image classification tasks.

   - **Advantages**:
     - It is faster to train due to transfer learning.
     - Requires less data to achieve high performance.
     - Good for resource-constrained environments.

   - **Disadvantages**:
     - The model may not be tailored specifically to the dog vs. cat dataset, as it is pretrained on a large and diverse set of images.
     - It might not capture domain-specific features in the images as well as a custom-trained model might.

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - **Why CNN?**
     - CNNs are designed specifically for image processing tasks and are the backbone of most modern image classification tasks.
     - Building a CNN from scratch allows for more flexibility in designing the architecture to suit the specific dataset (i.e., dog vs. cat).
     - While CNNs typically require more time and data to train compared to transfer learning, they are more customizable and can achieve higher performance when fine-tuned properly.

   - **Advantages**:
     - Customizable to suit the datasetâ€™s specific features.
     - Can be fine-tuned and optimized for higher accuracy over time.

   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires more computational resources and data.
     - May take longer to train compared to transfer learning.

## Improvement for Future Work:

### Suggested Improvement: **Fine-tuning the Pretrained MobileNet Model**
If more time and resources were available, one improvement that could enhance the performance of the model is **fine-tuning the MobileNet model**. Fine-tuning involves unfreezing some of the deeper layers of the model and training them on the specific dataset (dogs vs. cats) to adjust the learned features to be more relevant to the target task.

### Why Fine-Tuning:
   - **Domain-Specific Features**: Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the dog vs. cat images. It can help the model learn better features specific to this task, improving accuracy.
   - **Better Generalization**: While transfer learning helps in leveraging existing features, fine-tuning helps the model generalize better by adjusting the feature extractor layers to better suit the dog vs. cat classification task.
   - **Increased Accuracy**: Fine-tuning could result in better performance, especially if the pre-trained MobileNet model was trained on a dataset that has features that do not exactly match the dog and cat images.

### Steps for Fine-Tuning:
   - Unfreeze the last few layers of the MobileNet model and train them with a lower learning rate.
   - Adjust the learning rate of the newly added layers to allow the model to learn task-specific features while preserving the general features learned during the pre-training phase.
   - Experiment with different architectures for the final dense layers (adding more layers, changing the number of neurons, etc.) to better capture patterns in the dataset.

By implementing fine-tuning, the model would be more capable of accurately distinguishing between dogs and cats, improving its overall performance in the task.
