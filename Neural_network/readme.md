# 🧠 Neural Network Projects  

Welcome to the **Neural Network (NN)** folder! Here, I will be uploading my Neural Network-based projects, one by one. Each project will focus on building and applying different types of neural networks to solve real-world problems.  

## 📂 Projects in This Folder:  
🔍 **Project 1:** Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks  
   - A deep learning model to predict whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on given features.  
    

📚 **What You'll Learn:**  
- Basics of neural networks  
- Training and fine-tuning deep learning models  
- Evaluating the performance of NN models  
- Implementing models with **TensorFlow/Keras** and **PyTorch**  

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – For deep learning model building  
- **PyTorch** – For dynamic computation graphs and advanced model flexibility  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization  

## 📍 What's Next?  
Each project in this folder will provide hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and optimizing different types of neural networks, including:
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
- Transformer-based models (Upcoming)  

I will update this folder with new projects as I progress, so stay tuned for more! 🚀  

Feel free to explore the code and let me know your thoughts. Your contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
